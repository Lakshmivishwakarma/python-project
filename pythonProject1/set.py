# # intersection() or & using to get comman item in sets

# #7.Return a set of elements present in Set A or B, but not both
# # the symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are present in either of the sets, but not in both

# # 13.Python Program to Check if a Set Is Superset Itself or Another Given Set
# # issuperset() method is used to determine whether a set is a superset of another set.
# # A set is considered a superset of another set if it contains all the elements of the other set.

# set2 = {10, 45, 34, 20, 11}

# print("Is set2 superset of set1?:", set2.issuperset(set1))
# print("Is set3 superset of set1?:", set3.issuperset(set1))

# # 14.Python Program To Check If a Given Value is Present in Set or Not
# set1 = {10, 45, 34, 20}
